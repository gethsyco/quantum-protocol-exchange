# Quantum Protocol Exchange

**Quantum Protocol Exchange** is an advanced, multi-phase transaction framework designed for the Clarity smart contract ecosystem. It introduces structured, channel-based asset transfers with fine-grained control over state transitions, validation logic, anomaly detection, and fallback mechanisms.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Channel-Based Transaction Lifecycle**  
  Manage asset flows between entities using time-bound, verifiable channels.

- 🧠 **Multi-Phase Validation**  
  Implement structured, stage-based confirmation flows.

- 🔐 **Multisig Authorization**  
  Support threshold-based co-signers for high-value transactions.

- 🔎 **Anomaly Detection**  
  Monitor transactional velocity and volume to catch suspicious activity.

- 📡 **Advanced Monitoring & Notifications**  
  Delegate third-party monitors for threshold-bound events.

- ⏳ **Time-Locked Recovery**  
  Define fallback addresses with secure time-locked retrieval.

- 💸 **Rate-Limited Withdrawals**  
  Throttle asset extraction for large-volume operations.

## 📜 Key Contract Entities

- **ChannelRegistry**: Primary storage mapping for channel state
- **PROTOCOL_SUPERVISOR**: Elevated entity for administrative control
- **Status Transitions**: `"pending" → "completed" | "terminated" | "expired" | "reverted"`
- **Constants**: Includes protocol limits, errors, lifespan bounds
